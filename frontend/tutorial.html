            <h1>Our Spring Demo And How We Built it</h1>
            <h3>What is the Project</h3>
            <p>For our demo project, we built a simple full-stack CRUD todo application. Here, we will use Spring to
                implement all the business logic, database connections, REST endpoints, and web pages. </p>
            <p>We intentionally omitted some features so this guide doesn’t become overly long. As an added benefit,
                these omitted features leave the users with an exercise to try out themselves! Despite this, the demo
                should give a really good overview of the major features needed to make a full web application with the
                Spring framework. We also won&#39;t be styling the pages since that will be left for the Sass guide.</p>
            <h3>Initializing the Project</h3>
            <p>To start, go to the <a href="https://start.spring.io/">spring initializr</a> to initialize the Spring
                Boot application. To build the project like how we did, you will need to select the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maven as the build tool</li>
                <li>Java as the language</li>
                <li>2.6.0 as the Spring Boot version</li>
                <li>Jar as the packaging</li>
                <li>Java version 11</li>
            </ul>
            <p>along with the appropriate project metadata of your choice. For the dependencies, we used the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spring Data JPA for database operations</li>
                <li>Spring Security for authentication and authorization</li>
                <li>Thymeleaf as the templating engine</li>
                <li>Spring Web to create REST endpoints or view mappings (note you may opt to use the reactive web
                    dependency and a NoSQL database instead if you wish to leverage reactive programming. For
                    simplicity, we will not do this)</li>
                <li>The H2 database dependency for an in-memory database suitable for a development environment</li>
                <li>The MySQL driver dependency for use in production (note we won’t be showing how to deploy this to
                    production)</li>
                <li>Lombok to reduce the amount of boilerplate code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From there, you can download the project by selecting the generate button.</p>
