                Mixins
            What I didnt go over:
                Operators
                Extend/Inheritance
                Modules
             -->
            <h1>Sass</h1>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>Sass looks very similar to CSS, but it has a few tricks up their sleeve which 
                    can help you organize your CSS and make it more modular than it was before. A 
                    few simple features of Sass that will be covered are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Variables</li>
                    <li>Mixins</li>
                    <li>Nesting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are other features of Sass that you can use like use like
                    mathematical operators, extend/inheritance and modules which can 
                    be found through the official website:
                </p>
            <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide">https://sass-lang.com/guide</a>

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are declared by using the $ operator. They can store
                any CSS value you want to reuse. An example of a variable can be:
            </p>

            <pre><code>
            $bg-colour: #E9EBF1
            </code></pre>

            <p>You can also use them for fonts as well:</p>

            <pre><code>
            $text: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
            </code></pre>

            <p>You typically declare them near the top of the SCSS file so you
                can use throughout the file like so:
            </p>

            <pre><code>
            body {
                background-color: $bg-colour;
                font-family: $text;
            }
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Mixins</h3>

            <p>Mixins can be used to avoid repetitive code by compacting
                them into a single statement. They act like functions
                and you can even chose to pass in variables. However
                this example does not pass any variables.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
            // mixins, reuse this in each element I want to become a "card"
            @mixin card-theme() {
                background-color: $win-colour;
                box-shadow: 0px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
                border-radius: 5px;
                padding: 1em;
            }
            </code></pre>

            <p>Now whenever the line</p>

            <pre><code>
            @include card-theme(); 
            </code></pre>

            <p>is placed in an element, the CSS rules from the card theme 
                will be applied to the respectful element.
            </p>

            <h3>Nesting</h3>

            <p>You can edit elements nested elements using Sass's nesting
                elements using Sass's nesting features which can make your
                code more readable and easier to understand with the visual hierarchy.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
            form {
                padding: 2em 0;
                p {
                    font-size: 1em;
                    padding: 0.25em 0;
                }
            }
            </code></pre>

            <p>This will only style p elements that are within a form element.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>This covers the very basics of using Sass, you can learn more by
                going to the Sass website and finding the other cool features 
                that Sass offers. All the code snippets here were also used 
                in the tutorial website.
