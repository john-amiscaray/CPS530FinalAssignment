            <h1>Sass</h1>
            <h3>Did this framework perfom to your expectations?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I worked with Sass before and I find it easy to understand 
                and implement into the project.</p>
            <h3>Was it difficult to install or configure?</h3>
            <p>No, it was very simple as I used a VSCode extension to easily compile the SCSS files into CSS.</p>
            <h3>Was it easy to create pages with it?</h3>
            <p>Yes, it was straightforward.</p>
            <h3>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP?</h3>
            <p>Not really, since it was basically CSS with some cool extra features.</p>
            <h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</h3>
            <p>Yes. When designing the website, I should have taken into account
                 the reusability of CSS rules and elements which could have improved my
                  implementation of Sass into the website.</p>
            <h3>Do you regret your choice of framework?</h3>
            <p>No, I found it simple and sweet which gave me more time to put my creative energy into designing
                 the pages over worrying over how to implement them.</p>

            <h3>Did this framework perfom to your expectations?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Iâ€™ve worked with this framework a lot and know exactly what to expect from it. The 
                development process was smooth as always but there was a lot of boilerplate code.</p>
